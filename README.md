This is an simple Python application that Calculates multiple distances and automatically exports the data to a .csv file.
This uses Google Maps API to calculate distance.

How to use :
  Go to maps.py
  Go to line 15
  Enter your Google Maps API (https://developers.google.com/maps)
  Open GUI.py and Run it
  Thats it enjoy

This is my first every project, and there hasn't been any error checking or validation so there might be bugs in the app.
